DATA VISUALISATION 1

Version history:

Submission

Three submissions are required for this assignment:

The submission of a report through the unit website is required. In addition, publish your visualisation with Tableau Public and include the URL on the coversheet of your report.

Introduction

In this assignment you design and build an effective visualisation for data of a specific domain. This will require you to critically evaluate information in a domain of your choice and develop your own visualisation. The domain can be broad or specific depending on the availability of datasets and your interest. If you have difficulty finding an interesting dataset or domain, have a look at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets.

The aim of the assignment is to apply the data visualisation techniques examined during the first 6 weeks of the semester and demonstrate their use in an innovative context. As such, the visualisation should satisfy the following:

‚óè Why? It should address a particular need within a specific domain of your choosing. It must be targeted to the domain, its needs, and its users. This does not mean the visualisation has to solve an existing problem, but it must be a visualisation that is useful or relevant to people with an interest in the chosen domain.

‚óè What? It should use a data source relevant to the domain. Data can be of any kind.

‚óè Who? Design your visualisation for the average Australian or Malaysian.

‚óè The visualisation must turn data into something meaningful and provide insight that would otherwise be difficult to obtain without the visualisation.

‚óè It must provide interactive exploration.

‚óè It needs to show some innovation. It does not have to be wholly original but cannot be a replica of a visualisation that already exists. It could be an innovative visualisation idiom, or an innovative exploration of an interesting dataset.

‚óè It must demonstrate the use of the Five Design Sheet methodology for sketching and planning the design of your visualisation.

‚óè It must demonstrate the use of the Munzer What/Why/How framework discussed in lectures for correctly assessing the type of data, the goals of the visualisation and the design of the visualisation.

Task Description

1. Choose a domain that you would like to explore.

2. Find relevant datasets that are publicly available.

5. Implement your design with Tableau

6. Write a concise report with a maximum length of 1000 words (excluding the bibliographic list) covering the following:

a. A title page including the number of words and a URL of your visualisation.

b. A brief description of the domain, Why and Who.

c. What: A brief description of the data (sources, authors, relevance, creation process, etc.).

d. Why and How: Give a rationale for choosing the specific idioms and explain how they help the users to achieve their tasks. Include at least one screen capture of your entire visualisation, and a description of features that are special to your visualisation.

e. Design: Briefly explain the rationale for your choices of

i. Layout: How did you structure the layout in columns and rows?

ii. Colour: What are the reasons for selecting the specific colours of your visualisation, and how did you consistently apply the colours to charts, text, and figures?

iii. Figure-ground: How did you vary graphical elements to create a visual hierarchy?

iv. Typography: What are the reasons for selecting the specific typeface(s) and text layout?

v. Storytelling: How is the reader guided through the visualisation by using annotations and other means.

f. Bibliography/list of references.

Expectations

Format: The entire visualisation must be accessible through a single URL. The entire visualisation must be visible on a single web page that can be scrolled. There should be no buttons (or other web links) that swap the major section of the web page, but you can use buttons to show and hide visualisation elements.

Presentation not exploration: The goal of this assignment is to create a visualisation that communicates interesting information in an easily accessible and graphically engaging way using storytelling elements, layout principles, typography, and graphical design. The goal is not to create an expert tool for exploring and analysing a dataset.

Quality not quantity: Your visualisation will likely contain between 3 and 10 charts or diagrams that you create. There is no minimum or maximum number of charts. Instead, we are looking for carefully designed and annotated charts that ‚Äì in combination with text, icons and pictures ‚Äì guide the user through an interesting story using layout principles, typography and graphic design principles. Avoid pixelated images, non-informative graphical elements, or trivial text. Complement your visualisation with concise, informative and grammatically correct text.

Interactivity: Interactive features are easy to add in Tableau. Integrate interactivity where it makes sense, but do not just add interactive elements for their own sake.

Maps: Geographic maps will be required for the second visualisation assignment. For this first visualisation assignment, it is recommended to use non-geographic idioms; geographic maps will be ignored when marking your submission.

Authorship: Because your visualisation is publicly accessible, you should indicate your authorship and the license under which you make your work accessible.

Report content: The report must not include an introduction to the visualisation topic or extra information about the topic. The visualisation itself needs to tell the entire story. There is no need to include a table of contents or a conclusion in the report.

References in the report: Your report must include properly formatted references to the datasets, sources of information that you used to create your visualisation, possibly similar visualisation in the same domain, and photos, schemas, etc.) that you include in your visualisation. Your text needs to include in-text citations, and your report needs to contain a list of bibliographic references. The referencing style in this course is APA 6th [link], which is the recommended style for undergraduate students in the Faculty of Information Technology. Note that every in-text reference needs to be listed in the bibliographic list, and every entry in the bibliographic list needs to be referenced in the text.

Figures in report: Figures need to be numbered and referenced in the text with the figure number. Every figure needs to have a caption.

Marking

This assignment is worth 25% of the final unit mark. A detailed marking rubric is on the next page. If the report does not include a working URL to your visualisation the Visualisation a, b and c (see rubric) are marked with 0.
